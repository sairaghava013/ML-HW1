Q2 (Improve): Is the data preprocessing process proposed in the Kaggle post the best preprocessing solution? If yes, please explain why. If not, can you leverage what you learned in the class and your previous experiences to improve data processing, to obtain better accuracies for all these classification models? Describe what is your improved data preprocessing, and what are your improved accuracies? 
As a part of data – preprocessing, apart from handling null values, noisy data and correlation analysis, I have handled outliers, detected and removed the outliers. For Perceptron, Linear SVC, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Naive Bayes models have affected accuracies i.e., the accuracy for these models is increased and the other model’s accuracy has not been affected.
